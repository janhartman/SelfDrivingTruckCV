# Self-driving truck
## Applied Computer Vision project

The aim of this project is to simulate a simple self-driving vehicle in a video game. I chose 
[Euro Truck Simulator 2](https://eurotrucksimulator2.com/) because of its simplicity and customization options.

This project is written in Python 3 (using OpenCV) and made to run on Windows (I use Windows APIs for simulating 
keypresses and capturing the screen, but these can be switched with the appropriate replacements for other operating systems).
